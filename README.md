***Customer Compass: Mapping Behavior & Satisfaction***
📌 **Overview**

Customer Compass is a data science project aimed at analyzing customer satisfaction and loyalty by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Using structured demographic and behavioral data along with unstructured textual feedback, the system predicts satisfaction levels, classifies sentiments, and identifies key factors influencing customer experience.

The project further delivers interactive visualizations and a dashboard, offering actionable insights that businesses can use to enhance customer service strategies, improve retention, and optimize decision-making.

🚀 **Features**

- Customer Satisfaction Prediction using ensemble regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Stacking).

- Sentiment Analysis of customer feedback with DistilBERT (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).

- Data Integration of structured (demographics, purchase frequency) and unstructured (comments) sources.

- Actionable Insights through key driver identification and segmentation.

- Scalable System Design capable of handling real-time analysis.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
